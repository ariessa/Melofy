## Testing the App

1. Find out your device's CPU architecture.

> **_NOTE I:_**  Refer to this [article](https://android.gadgethacks.com/how-to/android-basics-see-what-kind-processor-you-have-arm-arm64-x86-0168051/) to find out your device's CPU architecture.

2. Check out [Melofy's latest release](https://github.com/ariessa/Melofy/releases/latest).

3. In Melofy's latest release page, expand the Assets section.

4. Download the specific release APK based on your device's CPU architecture and install it.

+ For `ARM`, use _app-armeabi-v7a-debug.apk_
+ For `ARM64`, use _app-arm64-v8a-debug.apk_
+ For `x86_64`, use _app-x86_64-debug.apk_

Or, you can download the fat APK that can be installed on `ARM`, `ARM64`, and `x86_64`.

+ The Fat APK is _app-universal-debug.apk_

> **_WARNING I:_** There is no apk for x86 Android. This is because Flutter does not currently support building for x86 Android. Refer to this [issue](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/9253) on Github.

> **_WARNING II_** These builds are intended for debugging purposes only. Usage outside of debugging may cause unexpected crashes and performance lags.
